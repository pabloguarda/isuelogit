- Timestamp: The date and time of the beginning of the summary interval. For example, a time of 08:00:00 indicates that the aggregate(s) contain measurements collected between 08:00:00 and 08:04:59. Note that second values are always 0 for five-minute aggregations. The format is MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.

- Station: Unique station identifier. Use this value to cross-reference with Metadata files.
- District:	District #
- Freeway #:	Freeway #
- Direction of Travel: N | S | E | W
- Lane Type:	A string indicating the type of lane. Possible values (and their meaning are:
CD (Coll/Dist)
CH (Conventional Highway)
FF (Fwy-Fwy connector)
FR (Off Ramp)
HV (HOV)
ML (Mainline)
OR (On Ramp)
 
- Station Length:	Segment length covered by the station in miles/km.

- Samples: Total number of samples received for all lanes.

- % Observed:	Percentage of individual lane points at this location that were observed (e.g. not imputed).

- Total Flow:	Sum of flows over the 5-minute period across all lanes. Note that the basic 5-minute rollup normalizes flow by the number of good samples received from the controller [unit: Veh/5-min]

- Avg Occupancy:	Average occupancy across all lanes over the 5-minute period expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1.	[unit: %]

- Avg Speed:	Flow-weighted average speed over the 5-minute period across all lanes. If flow is 0, mathematical average of 5-minute station speeds. [unit: Mph]

- Lane N Samples:	Number of good samples received for lane N. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location.

- Lane N Flow	Total: flow for lane N over the 5-minute period normalized by the number of good samples.	[unit: Veh/5-min]

- Lane N Avg Occ:	Average occupancy for lane N expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location.	[unit: %]

- Lane N Avg Speed:	Flow-weighted average of lane N speeds. If flow is 0, mathematical average of 5-minute lane speeds. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes [unit: Mph]


- Lane N Observed: 1 indicates observed data, 0 indicates imputed.
